1. Clone the repository
2. Open index.html in a web browser
3. Complete your profile
4. Import job data or use the demo data

## How the Job Matching Works

The application uses a sophisticated matching algorithm that considers:

1. **Skill Matching**: Analyzes the overlap between user skills and job requirements
2. **Experience Matching**: Compares years of experience with job requirements
3. **Location Matching**: Evaluates location preferences against job locations
4. **Role Matching**: Assesses how well the target role matches job titles

Each factor is weighted according to importance, with skills typically having the highest weight.

## Career Roadmap Generation

The career roadmap is generated by:

1. Identifying the current and target roles
2. Calculating interim steps based on experience gap
3. Analyzing skill gaps for the target role
4. Creating a timeline for skill acquisition
5. Recommending learning resources for each skill
